# Display to Light

Live: [https://filipchalupa.cz/display-to-light/](https://filipchalupa.cz/display-to-light/)

This project grabs a webcam feed and extracts two dominant colors from it which are then send through bluetooth to two [Neewer RGB660](https://neewer.com/products/neewer-led-light-10096807) lights.

## Motivation

This utility helps me record myself playing VR games with more immersive style by casting colors onto my back. Check the video below.
